# JAVA EXERCISES

This is a set of four simple Java exercises. The project was created using Intellij IDEA and is organized in such a manner that it has a main file (Main.java) where it lists all questions and allows you to choose which you'd like to view the solution.
The questions are as follows:
1. Write a program called Fibonacci to display the first 20 Fibonacci numbers F(n), where F(n)=F(n–1)+F(n–2). Also compute their average.
2. Write a program called CozaLozaWoza which prints the numbers 1 to 110, 11 numbers per line. The program shall print "Coza" in place of the numbers which are multiples of 3, "Loza" for multiples of 5, "Woza" for multiples of 7, "CozaLoza" for multiples of 3 and 5, and so on.
3. Write a program that sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm.
4. Write a Java method to find the smallest number among three numbers.
